## Plan for our little analysis

We will demo: 

- data visualization with `ggplot2`
- reproducible reports with RMarkdown
- version control with Git and GitHub
- publishing our report as a website!!!


Data:

We'll be using data from the National Park Service: Annual Visitation by Park from 1979-2017. <https://irma.nps.gov/Stats/Reports/National>.

Our website url:

We will publish this to <http://jules32.github.io/demo/whoi>.

## Setup information and code

We'll clearly identify the requirements to do this analysis: R packages and data sources.

```{r setup, warning=FALSE, message=FALSE}
## load libraries
library(tidyverse) # install.packages("tidyverse")

## import data
np_visit <- read_csv("https://raw.githubusercontent.com/allisonhorst/data-vis/master/np_visit.csv")
```

## Explore National Parks in California

These data are already tidy, so we can subset the data we want to explore and visualize it.

```{r ca national parks}
## first filter National Parks in California
np_california <- np_visit %>% # introduce pipe operator?
  filter(type == "National Park" & state == "CA")

## and now scatter plot
ggplot(data = np_california, aes(x = year, y = visitors)) + 
  geom_point(aes(color = park_name)) +
  labs(title = "California National Park Visitation")

## and now box plot
ggplot(data = np_california, aes(x = park_name, y = visitors)) +
  geom_boxplot(aes(fill = park_name)) +
  coord_flip() +
  theme(legend.position = "none")
```

## Let's add a photo
